# Chat UI

The frontend for a simple chat service. [Demo here](http://dadistcoder.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/)

To run on local

```
git clone https://github.com/zhiyanfoo/ui.git
npm install
npm run start
```

To properly use it you would need to run the backend at the same time. You can get it [here](https://github.com/zhiyanfoo/chat-haskell-backend)
